# **Turing's Playground - Guardians of Skies** 🚁  

## **Introduction**  
A robust object detection system capable of identifying and localizing **military aircrafts** in aerial images. The system classifies aircrafts as **friendly** or **enemy** and **triggers alerts** for enemy aircrafts to ensure the protection of **Egyptian airspace**.  

### **Key Features**  
✅ **Aircraft Detection:** Identify and localize military aircrafts in aerial images.  
✅ **Classification:** Categorize aircrafts as **friendly** or **enemy**.  
✅ **Alert System:** Trigger alerts for enemy aircrafts to enhance airspace security.  
✅ **Bounding Boxes:** Draw bounding boxes around detected aircrafts with classification labels.
